Next Week: Report of Discovering History in China

# Skinner

1. the city curve, see GOOD NOTES

2. totally 7 levels of cities, based on hierarchy

3. movement between the same level markets is much smaller between different level markets

4. the price of rice, if move together then it's a international market, otherwise not.

5. 防止地方势力膨胀，行政上将同一文化区域进行区分，如江苏（苏南和苏北的行政统一）

6. circles in Chinese History(population, development, etc.)

7. catria: critiques applying the west system to China; too general and ignore the regional situations

### revolutions in the countryside, cannot follow the market hierarchy ???
